The morning sun filtered through the café windows as Sarah approached the corner table. She had been looking forward to this meeting for weeks, though a nervous flutter in her stomach reminded her of what was at stake.

"You're early," said Marcus, glancing up from his newspaper with a warm smile. "I was just reading about the new art exhibition downtown."

"I couldn't sleep," Sarah replied, settling into the chair across from him. "I kept thinking about what we discussed last week."

The café buzzed with the gentle murmur of morning conversations, and the rich aroma of coffee beans filled the air. A barista called out orders while steam hissed from the espresso machine behind the counter.

"Well then," Marcus said, folding his newspaper carefully, "I suppose we should get straight to business. What have you decided about the partnership?"

"I think we should do it," Sarah said with conviction, her eyes meeting his directly. "But I have some conditions we need to discuss first."
